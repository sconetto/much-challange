This repository contains the codes for Much's challenge. All code was written in **Python 3.7.3**.

External packages used:

-   [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) (for code style)
-   [ipdb](https://pypi.org/project/ipdb/) (for debugging)
-   [ipython](https://pypi.org/search/?q=ipython) (for testing)

## 1. Product Group Tree

To execute the first challenge solution, run:

```bash
python3 challenge1.py
```

The `challenge1.py` must be on the same folder level as the JSON with the products (`product_groups.json`).

There is no output, the challenge has a logger that shows the creations being made.

The complexity of the algorithm is O(NÂ²) (Because of the ancestors search).

## 2. Random crashes

Work in Progress

## 3. Product Group Tree #2 - Bulk
